# Rocket_Elevators_RESTAPI2.0
Week 9 : CodeBoxx Odyssey - Modified &amp; Enhanced REST API


[REST API]

The REST API needs to be modified and enhanced to offer data through new interaction points:<br>
<br>
GET: Returns all fields of all intervention Request records that do not have a start date and are in "Pending" status<br>
PUT: Change the status of the intervention request to "InProgress" and add a start date and time (Timestamp)<br>
PUT: Change the status of the request for action to "Completed" and add an end date and time (Timestamp).<br>

--IMPORTANT--

For the PUT requests allowing us to change the statuses and add start/end dates. Simple replace the {id} placeholder with the Id of the intervention you wish to edit.
